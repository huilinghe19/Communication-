Usage of TangoEpics TangoDS:
Terminal 1: python3 ~/work/Communication-/TangoEpics/TangoEpics.py test

PyEpics must be installed under pip3:
>>> pip3 install pyepics



when I install something with PIP3 on diaz07, the PATH is different. Such as ipython3.
>>> pip3 install ipython
WARNING: The scripts iptest, iptest3, ipython and ipython3 are installed in '/net/home/oil/.local/bin' which is not on PATH.
  Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.


>>> export PATH=/net/home/oil/.local/bin
>>> ipython
